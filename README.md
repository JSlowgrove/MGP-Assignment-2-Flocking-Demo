Created by Jamie Slowgrove.  
You can do what you want with the code and in this project, however you must credit me and add a link back to the git repository.  
  
Created using SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf, JDK, ANT, Android NDK and the Android SDK:

Required steps to build on your computer:  
  
You will need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK), Android NDK, Android SDK and ANT to build on your computer.  
  
Once the JDK install you need to find the installation directory and create an Environment Variable for your computer  
called JAVA_HOME in all caps and the value should be the exact path to your JDK installation.  
(Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables)  
  
Inside the jni folder you must add the following folders:  
-SDL2, Containing the source code for SDL2.  
-SDL2_image, Containing the source code for SDL2_image.  
-SDL2_ttf, Containing the source code for SDL2_ttf.  
-SDL2_mixer, Containing the source code for SDL2-Mixer.  
  
Inside local.properties modify to the following:  
sdk.dir="Computer's Android SDK path location"  
ndk.dir="Computer's Android NDK path location"  
  
Inside buildDebug.bat modify the following:  
"C:\SDKs\android-ndk-r10d\ndk-build.cmd" to "Computer's Android NDK path location\ndk-build.cmd"  
  
Inside deployDebug.bat modify the following:  
"C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Android/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe"   
to "Computer's Android SDK path location/adb.exe"
